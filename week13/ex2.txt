Recovery:
+ we will use recovery more seldom than other methods, due to the fact that we use it only when deadlock actually occurs.
- it not always applicable since can not always make a roll back or kill the process.

Prevention:
+ it always works.
- it downgrades processes capabilities.

Avoidance:
+ on average outperforms other methos superior in many respects.
- require additional information about processes which is not always unavailable. So, in many cases can't be implemented.
